<b>Generate your own hackerman quotes</b></p>

## Idea

Hollywood and the media in general loves to portrait hackers as these beings that
make computers do anything! They just have to type fast enough,
or at least faster than the hacker on the other side.  

In countless shows and movies, characters say a lot of nonsense
to sound like a real badass hacker.  

If you also want to sound like a badass hacker but struggle to learn the basics
of computer engineering, don't worry, we got you covered!  

We created this sentence generator to make nonsense hacker quotes.  
Grammatically (more or less) correct English sentences mixed with
buzzwords to sound very technical, but don't make any sense.  

**Why?** Because we can! But also because it's fun and these quotes make great
jokes and can be used as placeholder text and descriptions.   

**One more thing...**  just a generator alone would be boring, so we are hosting
a website where anyone can easily get their daily dose of hacker quotes.  
Oh and we are creating an API for anyone to use.  
(Who needs Lorem-Ipsum when you can fill your website with hacker quotes!)

## Local Generator Script

The magic happens in [generator/hackergenerator.py](https://github.com/GlOwl/hackerman/blob/master/generator/hackergenerator.py).  
You can just run the script using `python3 hackergenerator.py`.  

The script expects 2 arguments: `python3 hackergenerator.py <number_of_quotes> <format>`.  
`<number_of_quotes>` is self expandatory (default = 1), `<format>` can be `csv` or `json` (default = csv).  

That's not enough for you? Try `python3 hackergenerator.py 1000`!  

You are a robot? Try `python3 hackergenerator.py 10 json`!
